,# Greetings
,# I am here to learn all that I can and to become job ready for a web developer position. I was raised in the Atlanta area. I hope that I can work in the southern region of the US. I am open to relocating. There are so many positions in the IT field that go unfilled, I am prepared to do whatever it takes for me to work in one of those fufilling positions.
